# üüß AWS Core Concepts ‚Äì Quick Reference

This document provides a concise summary of AWS fundamental concepts including Regions, Availability Zones, Edge Locations, and IAM (Identity and Access Management).

---

## üåç AWS Regions

- A **Region** is a **cluster of data centers** located in a specific geographical area.
- **Data never leaves a region** without explicit permission.
- **Reduced latency** by deploying resources closer to customers.
- **Service availability** varies by region; not all features are available everywhere.
- **Pricing** differs between regions and is transparently published on the [AWS Pricing Page](https://aws.amazon.com/pricing/).

---

## üè¢ AWS Availability Zones (AZs)

- Each Region contains **multiple Availability Zones** (AZs).
- Each AZ is **one or more discrete data centers** with:
  - Redundant power
  - Independent networking
  - Separate cooling
- AZs are **isolated from failures/disasters**.
- AZs are **connected via high-bandwidth, ultra-low latency networking**.
- Recommended: **Deploy resources across AZs** for high availability and fault tolerance.

---

## üìç AWS Points of Presence (Edge Locations)

- **Edge Locations** are used to deliver content to end users with **low latency**.
- They are part of AWS's **global infrastructure**.
- Utilized by **global services** such as:
  - **IAM**
  - **Amazon Route 53**
  - **Amazon CloudFront**
  - **AWS WAF**

---

## üîê AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)

### IAM Basics

- **Global service**, not region-specific.
- A **root account** is created by default when you sign up for AWS.
- **Users** = people in your organization.
- **Groups** = collection of users (groups can't contain other groups).
- Users can:
  - Belong to multiple groups
  - Not belong to any group at all
- **IAM Roles**
  - An **IAM Role** is an identity with **permissions policies** that can be **assumed by trusted entities** (like users, applications, EC2 instances, AWS services, etc.).
  - Roles are **not associated with a specific user or group**
  - Instead, they are **assumed temporarily** to gain access to AWS resources.

  ‚úÖ Key Use Cases of IAM Roles
  
  | Use Case                               | Example                                                                 |
  |----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | Grant AWS service permissions to resources | Allow an EC2 instance to access S3 using a role with S3 permissions     |
  | Cross-account access                   | Grant a user in Account A access to resources in Account B              |
  | Temporary credentials for users        | Allow federated users or apps to access AWS with temporary creds        |
  | Application or Lambda permissions      | Lambda assumes a role to access RDS, S3, DynamoDB, etc.                 |


### üîë IAM Permissions and Policies

- IAM uses **policies** (in JSON format) to define **permissions**.
- Follow the **Principle of Least Privilege**: only give the access that is needed.

#### Sample Policy Structure
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Id": "s3-acc-permissions",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "ReadOnlyAccess",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::mybucket/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Fields Explanation:**
- `Version`: Always `"2012-10-17"` for IAM policies.
- `Id`: Optional policy identifier.
- `Statement`: Contains permissions.
  - `Sid`: Optional statement ID.
  - `Effect`: `Allow` or `Deny`.
  - `Principal`: The user/account/role the policy applies to.
  - `Action`: Actions allowed or denied.
  - `Resource`: AWS resources affected.
  - `Condition`: Optional logic for applying policy (e.g., IP-based).

---

### üîí IAM Password Policy & MFA

- Protect IAM and root users with strong **password policies**.
- Use **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**:
  - Something you **know** (password) + Something you **have** (auth device).
  - Prevents account compromise even if password is stolen.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Access Keys, AWS CLI, and SDK

| Tool              | Authentication                       |
|------------------|----------------------------------------|
| AWS Console       | Username + Password + MFA             |
| AWS CLI           | Access Key ID + Secret Access Key     |
| AWS SDKs          | Same as CLI, used in application code |

- **Access Keys**:
  - Created via IAM in AWS Console.
  - Managed by each IAM user.
  - Do not share access keys.
  - **Access Key ID** = Username
  - **Secret Access Key** = Password

---

‚úÖ **Best Practices:**
- Always enable **MFA on root user**.
- Use **roles** for applications (e.g., EC2 instance profiles).
- Rotate **access keys** regularly.
- Review **IAM permissions** using AWS IAM Access Analyzer.

## üîç IAM Access Advisor & Credential Report

---

### ‚úÖ IAM Access Advisor

**IAM Access Advisor** helps you analyze **what services a user or role has accessed** and **when**.  
It allows you to review **unused permissions** and follow the **least privilege principle**.

#### üìç Where to Find:
- IAM Console ‚Üí Users or Roles ‚Üí Select a user/role ‚Üí Access Advisor tab

#### üßæ Access Advisor Output Example:

| AWS Service | Last Accessed     | Actions Granted       |
|-------------|-------------------|------------------------|
| S3          | 2025-07-12        | s3:ListBucket          |
| EC2         | Never Accessed    | ec2:StartInstances     |

Use this to **identify unused services** and **remove unnecessary permissions**.

---

### ‚úÖ IAM Credential Report

The **Credential Report** is a CSV file that provides an overview of **all IAM users** and their **credential usage**.

#### üìç Where to Find:
- IAM Console ‚Üí Credential Report (left panel) ‚Üí Click "Download Report"

#### üßæ Credential Report Example:

| User | Password Enabled | Password Last Used | Access Key 1 Active | Access Key 1 Last Used | MFA Active |
|------|------------------|---------------------|----------------------|------------------------|------------|
| root | true             | 2025-07-10          | false                | -                      | true       |
| dev1 | true             | N/A                 | true                 | 2025-06-15             | false      |
| ops  | false            | -                   | true                 | Never                  | true       |

#### üîç Key Fields Explained:
- `password_enabled`: Is console password enabled?
- `password_last_used`: When was it last used?
- `mfa_active`: Is MFA enabled?
- `access_key_X_active`: Is access key active?
- `access_key_X_last_used`: When the access key was last used?

### üß† Use Cases

| Use Case                             | Tool              | Action                                  |
|--------------------------------------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Identify unused access keys          | Credential Report | Deactivate or delete keys               |
| Detect users without MFA             | Credential Report | Enable MFA or restrict access           |
| Remove unused permissions            | Access Advisor    | Apply least privilege principle         |
| Audit compliance and security        | Both              | Provide data for security reviews       |
| Detect inactive users                | Credential Report | Remove or disable IAM user accounts     |

---

### ‚úÖ Best Practices:
- Review Access Advisor **monthly**.
- Enable **MFA** for all users.
- Rotate access keys **every 90 days**.
- Use **IAM roles** over users where possible.
- Regularly analyze the **Credential Report** for outdated or risky credentials.
